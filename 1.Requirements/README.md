# Requirements

## Introduction
 * To make life easier the world is moving towards e-commerce. 
 
 * At first ticket booking was a tedious proces which includes two actions of which the first is taking a ride to the place where the tickets are sold and then riding to the place at the right time it's inclusive of all kind of ticket booking like theatre ticket booking, bus reservation, railway reservation etc.
 
 * A Hotel Management System is untroublesome as it will serve the admin or user to be updated about the records without any strain and it is favored much by the people involved in the business sector. As we are aware of the busy and hectic schedule of business people, this Hotel Management System turns out to be a great relief for them.

* That tediousness had came to an end when everything was under a finger touch.

* This process includes the various bookings.

## Research
* The Next Generation e-Ticketing System (NGeT) was first launched in April 2014 to handle increased capacity for ticket booking as the existing system was not ready to handle the traffic. The booking capacity was increased from 2K tickets per minute to 15K tickets per minute in 2015.

* In 1994 the debut of the first online hotel catalog was launched.To improve the likelihood of filling rooms, hotels tend to use several of the above systems. The content on many hotel reservation systems is becoming increasingly similar as more hotels sign up to all the sites. Companies thus have to either rely on specially negotiated rates with the hotels and hotel chains or trust in the influence of search engine rankings to draw in customers.

* This resulted in the percentage of internet ticketing passengers overtaking the percentage of counter ticketing passengers for the first time in 2014-15, just as the 4G revolution was hitting India.
